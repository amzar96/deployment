## Deployment

## Overview
This is my personal playground where I explore and experiment with deployment methods like **Kubernetes** and **Docker**. The purpose of this project is to understand containerization and orchestration techniques for modern software development.

## Deployment Methods

### 1. Docker
Docker is used for containerizing applications to ensure they run in isolated environments. I have set up simple Docker containers to manage individual services.

### 2. Kubernetes
Kubernetes (K8s) is used for container orchestration, enabling me to manage, scale, and deploy containerized applications across a cluster.
